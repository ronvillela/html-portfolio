<p>This is my top most favorite movie of all time.  <br>
    The age old themes of honor and family and the use of
    the characters and dialogue to relay these themes are excellent. <br>  
    Consquently, the movie has won multiple awards and is still viewed by many today.<br>
</p>
<h3>Limitless</h3>

<p>This movie's plot based on a man down on his luck and willing to try anything to become a success is very appealing.<br>
In the end he understands that he must control this new power before it takes contorl of him.<br>
</p>
<h3>Goodwill Hunting</h3>

<p>I connect with the characters and the plot of this money so much.<br>  The main character, Will, reminds me of growing in one of the toughest
    neighborhoods in Boston.<br>  While dealing with the daily drama of a poor kid from the hood, Will eventually
    comes to terms with his demons and makes progress towards becoming a man.<br>
